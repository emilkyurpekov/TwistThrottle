# TwistThrottle

# **Overview:**
Welcome to my first web project 

This is a simple project for my final exam and it is a shop for motorcycle parts
# **Key Features:**
To run the application, you need to set your MySQL username and password in the application properties

All tables should be created empty except the tables for users the categories and the products in it. There should be 3 categories with 3 products in each

Also since the functionality for the cart is in a seperate project named cart-service which is also a Spring project you need to run the cart-service project first in order to either add, remove, update the cart or complete an order

After running the project successfully you will have 2 users:

1 Admin user:
Email:admin@twistthrottle.com
Password:password

2 Normal User:
Email:user@twistthrottle.com
Passowrd:password

# **Technologies Employed:**
Spring Web, JPA, MySQL Database, Lombok, Rest Services, Mapstruct, JavaScript
