# TwistThrottle
**CURENTTLY THE APP IS IN A PROCESS OF DEPLOYMENT IN CASE YOU WANT TO SEE AND USE IT YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE APP PROPERTIES OF BOTH SERVICES**
# **Overview:**
Welcome to my first web project 

This is a simple project for my final exam and it is a shop for motorcycle parts
# **Key Features:**
1. Creating a profile and adding motorcycles that you own or owned in the profile
2. Adding products in a cart and removing them
3. Placing an order 
Bonus: Admin users can change the roles of other users

To run the application, you need to set your MySQL username and password in the application properties

All tables should be created empty except the tables for articles, users the categories and the products in them. There should be 3 categories with 3 products in each

Also since the functionality for the cart is in a seperate project named cart-service that is consumed via REST from the main project you need to run the cart-service project first in order to either add, remove, update the cart or complete an order

After running the project successfully you will have 2 users:

1 Admin user:
Email:admin@twistthrottle.com
Password:password

2 Normal User:
Email:user@twistthrottle.com
Passowrd:password
